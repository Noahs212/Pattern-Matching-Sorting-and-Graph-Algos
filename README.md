# Pattern-Matching-Sorting-and-Graph-Algos
An implementations of several sorting, graph, and pattern matching algorithms for generic data types and included unit testing. As well as edge, graph, vertex, disjoint set, and disjoint set node classes for the graph algorithms. 

Sorting Algorithms:
  insertion sort,
  cocktail sort,
  merge sort,
  quick sort,
  lsd radix sort,
  heap sort,
  
Pattern Matching Algorithms:
  Knuth Morris Pratt,
  Boyer Moore,
  Rabin Karp

Graph Algorithms:
  breath first search,
  depth first search,
  Djikstra's,
  Kruskall's,

Includes unit test files:
